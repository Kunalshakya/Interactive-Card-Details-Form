## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries and responsive design
- JavaScript functions and DOM events
- Regular expresions(RegEx)
- Validations form


### What I learned

The project's layout is quite intricate due to the inclusion of images. My first lesson from this project was on designing a layout that integrates images effectively, and my second lesson was on implementing form validation.
